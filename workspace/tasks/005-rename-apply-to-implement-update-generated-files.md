# Update Generated Command Files

## End Goal

All generated slash command files in this repository use `implement` instead of `apply`.

## Currently

The repository has generated command files at:
- `.claude/commands/splx/apply.md`
- `.cursor/commands/splx-apply.md`

These were generated by `splx init` or `splx update`.

## Should

- Delete old `apply` command files
- Run `splx update` to regenerate with new `implement` names
- Verify new files are created correctly

## Constraints

- Only update files that were generated by PLX (have PLX markers)
- Preserve any user-added content outside markers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Old `apply` files removed
- [x] New `implement` files created
- [x] Files contain updated workflow with `splx get task`

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Delete `.claude/commands/splx/apply.md`
- [x] Delete `.cursor/commands/splx-apply.md`
- [x] Run `splx update` to regenerate command files
- [x] Verify `.claude/commands/splx/implement.md` exists with correct content
- [x] Verify `.cursor/commands/splx-implement.md` exists with correct content
- [x] Verify content uses `splx get task` workflow

## Notes

This task should be done after all code changes are complete and tests pass.
