# Task: Update NPM Package Page with Playwright

## End Goal

The npm package page for `@appboypov/OpenSplx` is updated manually. The user will handle this directly on npmjs.com.

## Currently

- Package page needs to be updated after publishing the new package
- Package description and README may need updates

## Should

- User manually updates npm package page at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appboypov/OpenSplx/edit
- Package description reflects OpenSplx branding
- README is synced from package

## Constraints

- [ ] User will manually update via npmjs.com web interface
- [ ] Must be done after package is published

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User manually updates npm package page at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appboypov/OpenSplx/edit
- [ ] Package description updated to reflect OpenSplx branding
- [ ] README is synced/updated on npm package page

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] 6.1 Navigate to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appboypov/OpenSplx/edit (after package is published)
- [ ] 6.2 Update package description if needed
- [ ] 6.3 Verify README is synced from package
- [ ] 6.4 Save changes

## Notes

This is a manual task to be done after publishing the new `@appboypov/OpenSplx` package to npm. The user will update the package page directly via the npmjs.com web interface.
